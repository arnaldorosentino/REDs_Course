## Module 9: Case Studies

### Hosting Capacity Studies

#### 1. HC analysis with fixed generation allocation

This topic presents an example of Hosting Capacity with fixed allocation in a 30-bus model system. The following assumptions are adopted:

- Feeder Model: Offpeak load condition
- Metric: Overvoltage
- Allocation of generators, chosen at random, with a value of 2000 kW.

Since the allocation is carried out randomly, different hosting capacity results can be obtained. In this way, the simulation was run 1000 times, generating the following results:
- Plot: HC x Iteration;
- HC Median value;
- HC Maximum value;
- HC Minimum value;
- HC Histogram.

#### 2. HC analysis with PV and Storage System allocation. Storage with time controller

This topic presents an example of Hosting Capacity analysis with allocation of PV System and Storage System in a 37-bus model system through Time controller. It is considered the storage system with time controller. The following assumptions are adopted:

- Loadshape of all loads with residential characteristics
- Metrics: Overvoltage and Overload
- It is randomly defined that 80% of the buses will be connected with DERs

 The following results are obtained:
- Identifies whether there was overvoltage or overload;
- Identifies the hours when overvoltage or overload occurred;
- Identifies the number of buss with overvoltage or overload at each time;
- Identifies the bus with the highest level of overvoltage or overload.

#### 3. HC analysis with PV and Storage System allocation. Storage with Volt-Var controller

This topic is similar to the previous one. The difference is that the the storage system was modeled with Volt-Var controller. The same assumptions were adopted. Moreover, the same results were obtained.

Simulation file:

- File *.py: [37-BUS_PV_Volt-var.py](https://github.com/arnaldorosentino/REDS_OpenDSS_Course/blob/main/37-BUS_PV_Volt-var.py)

*Note:* The *.dss files are the same that the previous one. 

#### 4. HC analysis with PV and Storage System allocation. Storage with Volt-Watt controller

This topic is similar to the Topic 2. The difference is that the the storage system was modeled with Volt-Watt controller. The same assumptions were adopted. Moreover, the same results were obtained.

Simulation file:

- File *.py: [37-BUS_PV_Volt-watt.py](https://github.com/arnaldorosentino/REDS_OpenDSS_Course/blob/main/37-BUS_PV_Volt-watt.py)

*Note:* The *.dss files are the same that the Topic 2.
